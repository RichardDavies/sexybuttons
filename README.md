The framework is focused on being simple yet flexible and strives to be as easy to implement as possible.

## Button Features

* The underlying HTML can use either `<button>` or `<a>` elements.
* They are dynamic and shrink/expand to fit their text labels.
* There are four states: normal, hover/focus, active, and disabled.
* The labels can include icons. Use one of the 1000+ included Silk icons or use your own. Icons are specified via HTML class attribute.
* They use the [sliding doors](http://alistapart.com/articles/slidingdoors/) CSS technique for increased performance.
* They support different skins by simply changing an HTML class attribute.
* A layered Photoshop template is provided to assist in creating new skins.
* Easy to implement.
* No Javascript required.
